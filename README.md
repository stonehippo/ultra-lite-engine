# Ultra Lite Engine

Ultra Lite Engine is a simple engine for driving roleplaying games. It is based on [GURPS Ultra-Lite](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/ultra-lite/).

## What's it for?

Ultra Lite Engine is a standalone engine that handles the most basic tasks of describing an RPG character's attributes and skills and provides a (very) simple engine for resolving tasks and combat. My goal was to provide a simple system that could be used as the basis for many types of games.
